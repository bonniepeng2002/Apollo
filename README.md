# :adhesive_bandage:	Apollo, an intuitive virtual nurse 	
In the age of a pandemic, limited access to healthcare is our current, devastating reality. <br>

## :bulb: Meet Apollo: our solution to this healthcare crisis, and your virtual nurse.

Apollo provides an intuitive interface that listens, documents and categorizes your symptoms during interactive virtual appointments. Based on these symptom logs, the app can suggest possible diagnoses and schedule appointments with a medical professional if necessary.

Apollo mends the healthcare crisis by being: 
1. More accessible than traditional healthcare;
2. More interactive than competing symptom trackers;
3. And a more proactive healthcare solution than mainstream telehealth.
